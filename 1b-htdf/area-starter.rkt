; PROBLEM:
; 
; DESIGN a function called area that consumes the length of one side 
; of a square and produces the area of the square.
; 
; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
; 
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.
; 


;; Number -> Number
;; given the length of one side of a square, produces the area of the square
(check-expect (area 3) 9)
(check-expect (area 2) (* 2 2))

;(define (area s) 0)    ;stub

;(define (area s)        ;template
;(... s))

(define (area s)
  (* s s))
